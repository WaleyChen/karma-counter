What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing this project?
Whether the project may be too difficult since I have no iOS/mobile experience.

Whether it's better to use Wi-Fi or the Multipeer Connectivity framework than the Core Bluetooth framework
in order to send karma.

Name two or three features that could be added to this project to improve the user experience.
Be able to specify how much karma to send.
Be able to see the history of karma sent and received.

Name two or three limitations of the described product that might cause problems if it were released publicly.
How fast and well does the app work when the app is receiving karma from multiple people at the same time?
How fast and well does the app work when the app is constantly receiving karma from a person who is different from the person I'm constantly sending karma to?

Since the iPhone can only pair with 1 other device at a time and creating a bluetooth connection is extra overhead,
I can't imagine the app being capable of sending karma in real time since it's likely to be slow from having to constantly
establish new connections in order to send and receive karma.

How long did this assignment take?
~50 hours.

What was the hardest part?
The hardest part was modifying the example Bluetooth connection code to support connections with multiple apps
since it was originally only built for 1 to 1 bluetooth connnections.

If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Don't do too many things at once.
Pace yourself and make small focused changes.
Since small code changes and commits decreases likelihood of bugs and is less taxing mentally.

Did you learn something new?
I learned about iOS delegates, multithreading, programming and storyboards; Objective-C and Xcode.

Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
Yes.

Are there any iOS-related skills that you weren't able to demonstrate in this excercise? If so, what are they?
Nope.
