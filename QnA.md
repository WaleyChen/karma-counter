What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing this project?
Since the iPhone can only pair through Bluetooth with only 1 other device at a time and 
creating a bluetooth connection itself is extra overhead, I can't imagine the app being capable of sending karma 
in real time since it's likely to be slow from having to constantly establish new connections in order to send 
and receive karma. The question then becomes can karma be sent in near real-time? If not, is the app still worth
making then?

Name two or three features that could be added to this project to improve the user experience.
Be able to specify how much karma to send.
Be able to see the history of karma sent and received.

Name two or three limitations of the described product that might cause problems if it were released publicly.
How fast and well does the app work when the app is receiving karma from and sending karma to multiple people 
at the same time?
How well does the app work at scale e.g. hundrends of devices? That's difficult to test and replicate.

How long did this assignment take?
~50 hours.

What was the hardest part?
The hardest part was modifying the example Bluetooth connection code to support connections with multiple apps
since it was originally only built for 1 to 1 bluetooth connnections.

If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Don't do too many things at once.
Pace yourself and make small focused changes.
Since small code changes and commits decreases likelihood of bugs and is less taxing mentally.

Also, examine Multipeer Connectivity framework example apps and determine whether they'd be easier to use than
the Core Bluetooth framework.

Did you learn something new?
I learned about iOS bluetooth connection frameworks, delegates, multithreading, programming and storyboards; 
Objective-C and Xcode.

Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
Yes.

Are there any iOS-related skills that you weren't able to demonstrate in this excercise? If so, what are they?
Nope.
